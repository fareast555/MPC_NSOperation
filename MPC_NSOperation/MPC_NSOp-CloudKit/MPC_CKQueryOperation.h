//*****************
//This class runs a CKQuery on the CKRecordType passed, using the specified NSPredicate object.
//You can leave the predicate as nil on initWithCKRecord... provided the class is passed a
//predicate before execution by an intermediary adaptor block (see the MPC_NSOperations.h file for
//an example of this kind of block).

//Subscribe via KVO to the "individualRecord" CKRecord property to get records fed to your calling
//class as they arrive. Or you can wait for the operation to complete, then recover all records at
//once via the "records" array property.
